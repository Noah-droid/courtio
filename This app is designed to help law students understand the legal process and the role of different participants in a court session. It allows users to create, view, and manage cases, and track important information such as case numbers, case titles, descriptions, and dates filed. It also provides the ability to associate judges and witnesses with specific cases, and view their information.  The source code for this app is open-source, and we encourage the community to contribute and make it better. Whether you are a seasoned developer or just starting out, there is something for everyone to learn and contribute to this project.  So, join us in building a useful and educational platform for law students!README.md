# courtio
Welcome to the courtio, a platform for law students to learn about court sessions and legal proceedings. The app is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, and provides an easy-to-use interface for managing and organizing court cases, judges, and witnesses.
This app is designed to help law students understand the legal process and the role of different participants in a court session. It allows users to create, view, and manage cases, and track important information such as case numbers, case titles, descriptions, and dates filed. It also provides the ability to associate judges and witnesses with specific cases, and view their information.

The source code for this app is open-source, and we encourage the community to contribute and make it better. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out, there is something for everyone to learn and contribute to this project.

So, join us in building a useful and educational platform for law students!
